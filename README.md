HELLO THIS IS SOPHIA HIGH SCHOOL S PROJECT
ITS CALLED INFINTY INSIDE


We want to foster a connection between kids and Maths as a lot of children are afraid of it, while some even find it boring. 
Through this software we plan on educating people on various interesting and unique Mathematical concepts, starting with basics like the Fibonacci sequence and operations on matrices. There is a small test yourself page to make the user's experience more fun and interactive.
